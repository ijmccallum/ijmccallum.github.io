# Culture ideas!

Because getting a good culture in the working environment can be a tricksy thing, 
these are some ideas of things to implement that hopefully feel a little less corporate.

## Open Invites

 - company / group calendar that anyone can add to
 - random events outside work that you're going to, specify time / place. If anyone else wants to show up, see you there!
 - not organised by leadership, more organic
 
## Sponsored Open Invites

 - For bigger trips that would require travel / lodging / equipment
 - if a bunch of work people decide to tag along
 - the company will contribute towards the overall cost (eg hire a minibus / lodging for the group)

## Alumni club

 - newsletter anyone can submit to, from within the company or from alumnis (because people are usually interested in people)
 - alumni access to see / submit Open Invites
 - quarterly / biannual / annual meetup

## Code for _____ meetup

 - See the Code for America meetup organisation. They got it right. If your city / country doesn't have that, get the copmany to donate space / employee time for organising & prepping presentions
