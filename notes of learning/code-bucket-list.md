# Code Bucket list

## Languages to work with in a production app:

 - [x] JavaScript *Love it! Bread and butter.*
 - [x] PHP *Not really a big fan of this one, didn't really click.*
 - [ ] Go
 - [ ] C/C++
 
https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/prereqs-and-prework
https://strapi.io/demo for any new APIs with basic content that I/a client creates

## Project Ideas:

 - [x] Make a [Static site generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mini-site-generator) just using js template strings.
 - [ ] Whisky Tracker: point tracking - one on one ...
 - [ ] Task wars / market: pay 'money' to assign tasks - more for a higher priority / ahead in the queue. Price adjusts depending on individual queues.
 - [ ] Chrome extension: color the background of tabs based on url keywords (eg, "localhost" : dark grey, "staging": red, etc)
 - [x] [Console Madness](https://github.com/ijmccallum/consoleMadness): makes it look like you are doing something phenominal but you're just typing randomly
 - [ ] Javascript your Genome: http://genomejs.readme.io/docs/what-do-i-do - 1st get my genome sequenced, then do things with the data!
 - [ ] random: map out google location history https://codeburst.io/how-i-created-a-heatmap-of-my-location-history-with-javascript-google-maps-972a2d1be240
 - [ ] [WikiLogic](https://github.com/WikiLogic/WikiLogic): in progress!
 - [ ] Build some kind of map / plan thing with [WRLD](https://www.wrld3d.com/) here's a [tutorial](https://www.sitepoint.com/building-dynamic-3d-maps/). To link in with Westport & Co possibly.
 - [ ] Build a learning demo that explains graphically how Molecules, atoms, sub atomic particles, fermions / bosons / spin etc works.
 - [ ] Open Source P2P social network, this must exist already: something that does not connect to a central server & can communicate over wifi / bluetooth / any other available means... built on [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) 
 - [ ] npm module to ping a server every time you do a build in order to track who has a project set up and how long it's been since they worked on it. (would be an internal tool for agencies, no so much open source). Could include data like file sizes etc.

## Tools to learn:

 - [ ] Kubernetes
