##JS

  - [You Don't Know JS: this & Object Prototypes](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/this%20&%20object%20prototypes/README.md#you-dont-know-js-this--object-prototypes). I honestly though I knew `this`, turns out I didn't! 
  - [You Don't Know JS: Scope & Closures](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/tree/master/scope%20%26%20closures). I had scope & closures down, this took it a step further - it explained the mechanisum behind their creation. This also nailed `let` and `const` for me, not to mention the final example: the mechanisum behind module loaders just clicked after I figured that one out!
