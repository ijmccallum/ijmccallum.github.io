They use an Image service (eg Flickr) as an example. The services in that layout are reading images, writing images, and the database. Split with the idea that reading will most likely need to scale independently from writing, and in a different way.</p> <p>The high level concepts:</p> <p><em>Redundancy</em>. Just like you (should) have multiple copies of your data, same goes for services. &quot;Shared-nothing architecture&quot; - a system of nodes each of which can operate independently of the others, no central brain, no central point of failure! Eg, load balancing!</p> <p><em>Partitioning</em> - creating divisions within the data, eg all dog photos are stored on a dog data store partition and all cat photos stored on a cat partition.</p> <p><em>Caching</em>, relies on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality_of_reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;locality of reference&quot;<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> principle. Things that were just asked for are more likely to be asked for again. For services - each could have it's own cache (on disk and in memory) to check before going to a lower layer. A service's local on-disk cache will still be faster thar requesting a resource from a cache over the network. Though you will need a good load balancing strategy to avoid cache misses when subsequent requests are sent to different nodes by your load balancer.</p> <p><em>Global caches</em> would be another service that all nodes would query. They can either take responsibility for fulfilling a request from disk if a resource isn't already in the cache (the common way) or they can leave that up the the requester (if your application logic is better at caching strategies than your cache).</p> <p><em>Distributed caches</em> are, to my mind, a partitioned global cache. <a href="http://memcached.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">memcached<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> <a href="http://www.squid-cache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">squid<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> <a href="https://varnish-cache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">varnish<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></p> <p><em>Proxies</em> take a request, send it somewhere else, possibly modifying it. They can do some fancy things: Collapsed Forwarding - if multiple requests for the same data come in, they can be collapsed into one request to the resource. They can also collapse requests for spatially close data into one large request.</p> <p><em>Indexes</em>! Slower writes (update data and the index) faster reads. Really good for large collections of tiny things. Often they are in layers. They should be used tactfully, indexing too much information can result in indexes too large to be useful. Research in this area continues!</p> <p><em>Load Balancers</em>. <a href="http://www.haproxy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">haproxy<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> A central point from which requests can be split between multiple nodes. For complex systems there can even be multiple layers of them. One of the challenges is persistent session data, but then again I'm primarily a FED so I'll take care of that 😛 Splitting requests can be done randomly, interactively, or by utilization and capacity rates. They can also notice when nodes become unresponsive and take them out of the system (this feels a bit much for a load balancer to be doing imo, rather some kind of monitoring happening, but then again - I guess the load balancer will have to know when changes are made)</p> <p><em>Queues</em>. One server many clients, all request directly to the server, if one takes a while the others have to wait. If the server fails, the client fails. A queue would be another service that receives requests, pop them into a list, then workers pick up the task when they have capacity and fulfill it. They also protect from system failures and can retry failed requests. <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rabbitmq<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>, <a href="http://activemq.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">activemq<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>, <a href="http://kr.github.io/beanstalkd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kr.github.io<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></p> <h2 id="_2-firefox-release-engineering"><a href="#_2-firefox-release-engineering" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2. <a href="http://aosabook.org/en/ffreleng.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firefox Release Engineering<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></h2> <p>Automating the release process for firefox.</p> <ul><li>Post mortem on the build process after <em>every</em> build.</li> <li>Fix one thing, no matter how small, after every build.</li> <li>Treat every build as you would a quick fix build - so when quick fixes are needed, it's the norm.</li> <li>one person is build captain, they have to know the background of all updates, referee bug severity, run communication between all groups, be on point!
