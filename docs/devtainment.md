# Devtainment

Pretty much my own "Awesome list" of dev things whenever there's a moment to spare.

## Podcasts

### Dev podcasts

- [ShopTalk](http://ijmccallum.github.io/) Back and forth front end banter with a few different episode formats, "rapidfire" answering loads of listener questions, som e interviews, but mostly banter. Covers tech stuff, with opinions thrown in to more of the soft skills side of things. The second podcast I started listening to after Serial!
- [Codepen Radio](https://blog.codepen.io/radio/) The story behind Codepen, it starts off with the three founders talking about tech / start up issues. Later episodes have switched to more of an interview style show run by later additions to their team as CodePen has grown.
- **This Developers Life** A short series of podcasts about life as a developer. I think this may have been my third development podcast, after this it gets a bit hazy - too many to remember!
- **Javascript Jabber** Weekly chats and interviews about javascript, it's pretty wide ranging between soft and hard skills too.
- **Does Not Compute** A couple of developers chatting about development, they lean more towards the back end but client side code does make appearances!

## Silly things

> Debugging - being the detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer (coding blocks, ep 81 47:57)

```js
function stop(whatTime) {
  if (whatTime == "hammer time") {
    console.log(`duuu du du du      du du      du du`);
  }
}

stop("hammer time");
