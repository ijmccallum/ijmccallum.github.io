#Code Bucket list

##Languages to learn:

 - [x] *JavaScript* 
 - [ ] *C#*

* checked boxes don't actually mean I've "finished" learning a language. That would be insane.

##Mini project ideas to make:

 - C#: ???
 - JS: Chrome extension: color the background of tabs based on url keywords (eg, "localhost" : dark grey, "staging": red, etc)
 - [Console Madness](https://github.com/ijmccallum/consoleMadness): makes it look like you are doing something phenominal but you're just typing randomly
 - JS: Javascript your Genome: http://genomejs.readme.io/docs/what-do-i-do - 1st get my genome sequenced, then do things with the data!

##Big project ideas

 - [ ] [WikiLogic](https://github.com/WikiLogic/WikiLogic): in progress!
 - [ ] Open Source P2P social network, this must exist already: something that does not connect to a central server & can communicate over wifi / bluetooth / any other available means.
